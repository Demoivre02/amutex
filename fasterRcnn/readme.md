# Object Detection with SAHI and TorchVision

This project demonstrates object detection using the **SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference)** library and a **Faster R-CNN** model from **TorchVision**. The code processes an input image, performs sliced inference to detect objects, and visualizes the results.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. Loads a pre-trained **Faster R-CNN** model from TorchVision.
2. Uses the **SAHI** library to perform **sliced inference** on an input image.
3. Detects objects in the image and visualizes the results with bounding boxes.
4. Saves and displays the output image with detected objects.

---

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- `sahi`
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `IPython`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install sahi torch torchvision IPython
```

---

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Place your input image in the `images/` directory (e.g., `images/office.jpg`).

---

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

### Input
- The script expects an input image at `images/office.jpg`. You can modify the `image_path` variable in the script to use a different image.

### Output
- The output image with detected objects is saved in the `version5/output/` directory as `prediction_visual.png`.
- The output image is also displayed in the console (if running in a Jupyter notebook or IPython environment).

---

## Output

The script generates the following output:
1. **Visualization**: An image with bounding boxes around detected objects.
2. **Saved File**: The output image is saved as `prediction_visual.png` in the `version5/output/` directory.

Example output:
![Prediction Output](version5/output/prediction_visual.png)

---

## Customization

You can customize the following parameters in the script:
- **Image Path**: Modify the `image_path` variable to use a different input image.
- **Slice Size**: Adjust the `slice_height` and `slice_width` parameters to change the size of the slices used for inference.
- **Overlap Ratio**: Modify the `overlap_height_ratio` and `overlap_width_ratio` parameters to control the overlap between slices.
- **Confidence Threshold**: Change the `confidence_threshold` parameter to filter out low-confidence detections.

Example:
```python
result = get_sliced_prediction(
    image_path,
    detection_model,
    slice_height=600,  # Change slice height
    slice_width=600,  # Change slice width
    overlap_height_ratio=0.3,  # Change overlap ratio
    overlap_width_ratio=0.3,  # Change overlap ratio
)
```
