# FLOL Image Enhancement

This script enhances images using a pre-trained FLOL model. It loads an input image, applies enhancements, and saves the output.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (3.8 or later) installed, along with `pip` to manage dependencies.

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow numpy
```

## Running the Script

### Steps
1. **Prepare Input Image:**
   - Place the image you want to enhance inside the `images/` directory.
   - Modify `input_image_path` in the script to point to your image file.

2. **Execute the Script:**
   Run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python script.py 
   ```
   
   Ensure the script filename is correct when running the command.

3. **Output Image:**
   - The enhanced image will be saved inside the `FLOL/output/` directory with a prefix `enhanced_`.
   - The image will also be displayed automatically upon processing.

## File Structure
```
.
├── script.py              # Main script
├── images/                # Directory for input images
│   ├── low00772.png       # Sample input image
├── FLOL/                  # Output directory
│   ├── output/            # Directory for processed images
│   ├── weights/           # Directory containing the model weights
│       ├── flolv2_UHDLL.pt # Pre-trained model file
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Notes
- The script loads a pre-trained FLOL model from `FLOL/weights/flolv2_UHDLL.pt`.
- It applies deep learning-based image enhancement before saving the output.
- Ensure that the model file is available before running the script.
